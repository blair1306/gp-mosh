  // &quot;data&quot; remains the property of the caller but must remain valid until
  // the stream is destroyed.  If a block_size is given, calls to Next()
  // will return data blocks no larger than the given size.  Otherwise, the
  // first call to Next() returns the entire array.  block_size is mainly
  // useful for testing; in production you would probably never want to set
