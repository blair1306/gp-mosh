<doc f='include/google/protobuf/stubs/stl_util.h' l='61'>// Inside Google, this function implements a horrible, disgusting hack in which
// we reach into the string&apos;s private implementation and resize it without
// initializing the new bytes.  In some cases doing this can significantly
// improve performance.  However, since it&apos;s totally non-portable it has no
// place in open source code.  Feel free to fill this function in with your
// own disgusting hack if you want the perf boost.</doc>
