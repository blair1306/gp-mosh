<doc f='include/google/protobuf/io/coded_stream.h' l='198'>// Like ReadRaw, but reads into a string.
  //
  // Implementation Note:  ReadString() grows the string gradually as it
  // reads in the data, rather than allocating the entire requested size
  // upfront.  This prevents denial-of-service attacks in which a client
  // could claim that a string is going to be MAX_INT bytes long in order to
  // crash the server because it can&apos;t allocate this much space at once.</doc>
