  // Helper constants and functions related to the format.  These are
  // mostly meant for internal and generated code to use.

  // The wire format is composed of a sequence of tag/value pairs, each
  // of which contains the value of one field (or one element of a repeated
  // field).  Each tag is encoded as a varint.  The lower bits of the tag
  // identify its wire type, which specifies the format of the data to follow.
  // The rest of the bits contain the field number.  Each type of field (as
  // declared by FieldDescriptor::Type, in descriptor.h) maps to one of
  // these wire types.  Immediately following each tag is the field&apos;s value,
  // encoded in the format specified by the wire type.  Because the tag
  // identifies the encoding of this data, it is possible to skip
  // unrecognized fields for forwards compatibility.</doc>
