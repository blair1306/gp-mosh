   This is used for communication to and from the caller
   and for communication between successive calls to `getopt&apos;.

   On entry to `getopt&apos;, zero means this is the first call; initialize.

   When `getopt&apos; returns -1, this is the index of the first of the
   non-option elements that the caller should itself scan.

   Otherwise, `optind&apos; communicates from one call to the next
   how much of ARGV has been scanned so far.  */</doc>
