<doc f='include/google/protobuf/stubs/common.h' l='765'>// The protobuf library sometimes writes warning and error messages to
// stderr.  These messages are primarily useful for developers, but may
// also help end users figure out a problem.  If you would prefer that
// these messages be sent somewhere other than stderr, call SetLogHandler()
// to set your own handler.  This returns the old handler.  Set the handler
// to NULL to ignore log messages (but see also LogSilencer, below).
//
// Obviously, SetLogHandler is not thread-safe.  You should only call it
// at initialization time, and probably not from library code.  If you
// simply want to suppress log messages temporarily (e.g. because you
// have some code that tends to trigger them frequently and you know
// the warnings are not important to you), use the LogSilencer class
// below.</doc>
